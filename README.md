# http_server_by_pico_w
A simple website with functionality led controller and measuring voltage and temperature sensor from Raspberry PICO W microcontroller board.

One source of code for creating static web pages from Raspberry Pico W own server - choose directory ```HTTP_WEBSITE_STATIC_PAGE```

One source of code for creating dynamic web pages from Raspberry Pico W own server - choose directory ```HTTP_WEBSITE_WITH_CGI_SSI```

Please read instruction before start to do.

# Why I choose this project 

Becuase a small website is required small CPU and memory computer which able to save much more space in building and buy Raspberry Pico W much cheaper than usual computer server (including Raspberry Pi 4, old laptop and other).
Secondary reason, this network is not required public ip address and use private network ip address from DHCP server or router which using private usage purpose ideally for home webserver.
Raspberry Pico W has GPIO pins with multi-function which we can controller via website if we added this code of HTTP server. 
One important reason this webs server project is easier to install your web server than use embedded computer. 

Most PC haven't external GPIO pins like microcontroller.

Cost one Raspberry Pico W is £6.30. (Links: https://thepihut.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico-w)
Cost one PC is about £50 - 1000. 

I like a microcontroller board Raspberry Pi Pico W becuase it has rich features, functions, application and WIFI support.
